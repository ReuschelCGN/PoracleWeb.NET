# Alarm Management

PoracleWeb provides a browser-based UI for managing Poracle notification filters. Users create alarms that tell Poracle which Pokemon, Raids, Quests, and other events to send as DM notifications.

## Alarm types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pokemon** | Filter by species, IV, CP, level, PVP rank, gender, size |
| **Raids** | Filter by raid boss, tier, move, evolution, EX eligibility, specific gym, RSVP changes |
| **Eggs** | Filter by egg tier, EX eligibility, specific gym, RSVP changes |
| **Quests** | Filter by reward type and Pokemon |
| **Invasions** | Filter by grunt type and shadow Pokemon |
| **Lures** | Filter by lure type |
| **Nests** | Filter by nesting Pokemon species |
| **Gyms** | Filter by gym team changes, battle activity, specific gym |

## Creating alarms

Each alarm type has a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar navigation. The creation flow:

1. Click the **+** (add) button
2. Select the Pokemon/raid/quest target using the selector dialog
3. Configure filter options (IV range, CP range, level, etc.)
4. Set a **distance** — how far from your location to receive alerts (in meters)
5. Optionally select a **template** for notification formatting
6. Save the alarm

## Alarm cards

Alarms are displayed as a card grid. Each card shows:

- Pokemon sprite or raid/quest icon
- **Filter pills** — Quick-glance badges showing active filters (IV, CP, Level, PVP, Gender, Size)
- Distance setting
- Template name
- Edit/delete actions

## Bulk operations

Each alarm list page has a **select mode** toggle (checklist icon in the toolbar):

1. Toggle select mode on
2. Check individual alarms or use **Select All**
3. The bulk toolbar appears with available actions:
    - **Update Distance** — Set a new distance for all selected alarms
    - **Delete** — Remove all selected alarms

!!! tip "Bulk distance uses a dedicated endpoint"
    Bulk distance updates use `PUT /distance/bulk` which does a targeted SQL update without touching other alarm fields. This is safer than updating each alarm individually.

## Profiles

Users can maintain multiple alarm profiles. Only one profile is active at a time.

- Switch profiles from the **Profiles** page or the user menu
- Each alarm is associated with a `profile_no`
- The active profile is tracked by `humans.current_profile_no`

## Pokemon alarm filters

### Size filter

The size filter uses special sentinel values:

- **`size = -1`** — No filter (ALL sizes). This is the default.
- **`size = 1`** through **`size = 5`** — Specific sizes: 1 = XXS, 2 = XS, 3 = Normal, 4 = XL, 5 = XXL.
- **`max_size = 5`** — Default upper bound.

When a user selects a specific size, both `size` and `max_size` are set to the same value, creating an exact match. For example, selecting XXL sets `size = 5, max_size = 5`.

### Level range

The default maximum level is **55** (not 40 or 50), matching Poracle's support for shadow/purified/best-buddy boosted levels.

## Raid alarm filters

Raid alarms support these fields beyond the basic tier/boss selection:

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `team` | `4` (any team) | Gym team controlling the raid |
| `move` | `9000` (any move) | Filter by raid boss move |
| `evolution` | `9000` (any) | Filter by evolution type (e.g., Mega, Primal) |
| `exclusive` | `false` | EX/exclusive raid flag |
| `gymId` | `null` (all gyms) | Track a specific gym by ID |
| `rsvpChanges` | `false` | Receive RSVP change notifications |

## Egg alarm filters

Egg alarms support:

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `team` | `4` (any team) | Gym team controlling the egg |
| `exclusive` | `false` | EX/exclusive egg flag |
| `gymId` | `null` (all gyms) | Track a specific gym by ID |
| `rsvpChanges` | `false` | Receive RSVP change notifications |

## Gym alarm filters

Gym alarms support:

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `battleChanges` | `false` | Notify on battle activity changes at the gym |
| `gymId` | `null` (all gyms) | Track a specific gym by ID |

## Invasion alarm filters

Invasion alarms filter by grunt type. The `grunt_type` value is **automatically lowercased** on create because Poracle uses case-sensitive matching for grunt types.
