# Site Settings

Site settings are admin-configurable runtime settings stored in the `poracle_web.site_settings` database table. Unlike [appsettings.json configuration](reference.md) which requires a restart, site settings are changed at runtime via the **Admin > Settings** page and take effect immediately.

!!! info "First-time setup"
    On first startup after upgrade, the `SettingsMigrationStartupService` automatically migrates any existing data from the deprecated `pweb_settings` key-value store to the structured `site_settings` table. This is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

## How it works

- Settings are stored in the `poracle_web.site_settings` table with columns: `category`, `key`, `value`, and `value_type`.
- The admin panel at **Admin > Settings** provides a grouped UI for editing all settings.
- Changes take effect immediately — no app restart is needed.
- Boolean settings use `"True"` / `"False"` string values.
- Some settings have conditional visibility (e.g., `allowed_role_ids` only appears when `enable_roles` is enabled).
