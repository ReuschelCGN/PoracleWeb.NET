# PoracleWeb.NET

A web application for managing Pokemon GO notification alarms through the Poracle bot system. Compatible with both [PoracleJS](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS) and [PoracleNG](https://github.com/jfberry/PoracleNG). Users authenticate via Discord OAuth2 or Telegram and configure personalized alert filters (Pokemon, Raids, Quests, Invasions, Lures, Nests, Gyms) through a browser-based UI.
